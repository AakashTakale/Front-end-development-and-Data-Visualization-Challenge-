# Front-end-development-and-Data-Visualization-Challenge-
I was asked to perform a challenge where I needed minimum of two components in "at a glance" that must have full interactive capabilities when clicked into. 

My "At a glance" components where,
1) Dollars spent this week
2) Total Clients this year

"The Dollars spent this week" shows a interactive pie chart and "Total Clients this year" shows interactive bar graph.
